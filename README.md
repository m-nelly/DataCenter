# README
This repository is my personal knowledge base and contains most of the notes I have on penetration testing. There are still a few documents that are waiting to be integrated and a solid chunk of content that I'm not sure how to integrate yet. 

The knowledge base is broken up into four major sections (Checklists, Methodology, Theory, and the Toolkit). 
- Checklist: Overview of steps performed during an engagement. 
- Methodology: Technical instruction for performing engagement tasks.
- Theory: Detailed technical information or "book knowledge".
- Toolkit: A collection of useful resources for testing, reporting, etc.
