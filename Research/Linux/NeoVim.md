## Notes
### Why NeoVim
If you are coming from a modern IDE like VSCode, you might be very confused as to how this jumbled mess of keybindings and shortcuts could possibly make programming faster if you don't even have simple features like a debugger, file tree, or IntelliSense. I can assure you that all of these features are available in NeoVim with just a little work to get there. What you will end up with is a powerful editor that is completely tailored to your workflow and contains next to zero unnecessary features. 
### Vim Motions
I'm not going to include a rundown of Vim motions in this document because there are plenty of resources out there already; however, I will recommend the [Learn X In Y Minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/vim/) page on Vim to get started. You can also use the Vim tutor by issuing the command `:Tutor` from within NeoVim. I also recommend revisiting these things often, even if you are comfortable working with Vim to give yourself exposure to features that you might not be using yet. 
### Plugins
NeoVim has a rich plugin ecosystem which can be accessed via a package manager such as [Lazy](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) or one of NeoVim's many distributions such as [AstroNvim](https://github.com/AstroNvim/AstroNvim) or [LunarVim](https://github.com/LunarVim/LunarVim). My recommendation is to start with [Kickstart](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) and explore some other plugins on your own from there. Installing too many plugins and changing too many default settings will confuse you if you need to work on a default installation, or even worse, Vi. In the beginning, try to learn to do things the Vim way instead of trying to force fit your existing workflow into a new paradigm.
