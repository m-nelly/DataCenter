## Notes

Optimization is an iterative process in which performance gains are achieved through reconsidering the flow, order of operations, calculations, etc. being performed by a program. While this is a complex topic that requires a relatively deep understanding of programming as well as systems, optimization can be thought of as one part resource allocation and one part complexity reduction.
