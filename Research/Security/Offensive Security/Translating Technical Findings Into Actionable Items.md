Speaker: Cori Macy
Key Talking Points:
- Findings are useless if not translated properly
- Challenge: Communicating complex technical data to non-technical stakeholders
- Communication of findings to convey severity and impact is essential 
- When communicating to a technical audience, details are paramount to good communication
	- Risk metrics
	- Remediation strategies
	- Affected systems
- When communicating to a non-technical audience
	- Explain technical concepts briefly, but in enough detail to help the stakeholders understand the risks
	- Integrate findings into explanations of the technology/concepts behind them
	- Stay out of the weeds
		- Example: State server process at a high level (file sharing server)
	- Communication should be far more narrative in presentation and should integrate clear communication about risks
		- Use dramatic language as a way to convey severity 
		- Explain actions that could proceed/precede the findings you are communicating
		- Metaphors are a powerful tool for communicating technical terms
- Invite Q&A and follow-up as needed
- Incorporate visuals, stories, infographics, screenshots, and before/after tables
Google Points:
- Assumed breach scenario - Types? Expand on that and integrate into [[Client Communication]]
