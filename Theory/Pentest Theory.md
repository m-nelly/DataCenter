## Common Tactics
### Enumeration:
**OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)** - Information gathering using publicly available resources including social media, search engines, public records, and other common content discovery methods. 
**Port Scanning** - Tools like NMAP or RustScan can be used to enumerate the services running on a network. These scanners will usually only test for open TCP ports and can be inaccurate depending on security measures put in place. 
**Subdomain Discovery** - Subdomains are prefixes added onto the base domain such as *subdomain*.example.com. Subdomains can be enumerated using SSL certificates, websites such as DNS Dumpster, or tools such as GoBuster. 
**Directory Brute Forcing** - While noisier than the other methods, directory brute forcing on web applications can reveal sensitive data as well as potentially vulnerable endpoints such as legacy login portals. 
### Network Attacks
**SMB Null Sessions** - Misconfigured SMB servers might allow users to authenticate to SMB without a username or password or with the guest account and no password. This could allow you to read all of the files in SYSVOL or other file shares present on individual systems.
**LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning** - On most networks, it is possible to send responses to LLMNR and NBT-NS requests and impersonate a legitimate service to capture hashes. 
**WPAD/mDNS Spoofing** - On most networks, it is possible to spoof responses to mDNS and WPAD requests to man-in-the-middle traffic between the requesting device and the intended destination. 
**IPv6 Attacks** - By default, Windows devices attempt to use IPv6 to find domain controllers which allows attackers to respond to devices attempting to locate a domain controller and collect hashes. 
**NTLM Relay/Pass-The-Hash** - With captured NTLM hashes, it is sometimes possible to relay or pass those credentials to authenticate to another system without having to crack the NTLM hash. 
**ADCS Attacks** - Misconfigured certificate templates can allow a low-privilege user to request certificates that allow them to authenticate as a high-privilege user. 
### Web Application Attacks
**Subdomain Discovery** - Subdomains are prefixes added onto the base domain such as *subdomain*.example.com. Subdomains can be enumerated using SSL certificates, websites such as DNS Dumpster, or tools such as GoBuster. 
**Directory Brute Forcing** - While noisier than the other methods, directory brute forcing on web applications can reveal sensitive data as well as potentially vulnerable endpoints such as legacy login portals.
