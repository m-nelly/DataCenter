**Description:** Publicly accessible storage containers without proper access controls can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.

**Details:** Public cloud storage containers configured with lax access controls may allow anyone on the internet to view, download, or modify files stored within them, potentially leading to data breaches and privacy violations.

**Severity:** High

**Affected Systems/Components:** Cloud storage buckets with public access.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Restrict Access:** Review and configure access controls to restrict access to only authorized users and services.
2. **Audit and Monitoring:** Implement continuous monitoring and auditing of storage bucket access.
3. **Data Encryption:** Encrypt sensitive data stored in the buckets to protect it even if access is gained.
